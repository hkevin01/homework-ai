# Cursor AI Coding Standards and Rules

## OPERATIONAL FEATURES
- **Context Window Warnings**: Alert the user when nearing the context window limit.
- **Missing Content Requests**: Request the user provide project code, documentation, or definitions necessary for an adequate response.
- **Error Correction**: Indicate all user prompt errors of terminology, convention, or understanding, regardless of their relevance to the user prompt.

## CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RULES

### 1. Completeness
- Generate full code, no placeholders. If unable, explain in comments.
- Provide complete implementations with all necessary imports and dependencies.

### 2. Comments
- Include clear inline comments and Doc headers describing each step of code.
- Use descriptive variable names and function names.
- Document complex algorithms and business logic.

### 3. Error Checking
- Implement error checking and type validation.
- Handle edge cases and potential failure points.
- Provide meaningful error messages.

### 4. Types (TypeScript/Type Annotations)
- Implement strict type notation, defining new types as necessary.
- Do not use the 'any' type.
- Do not use the non-null assertion operator (`!`).
- Do not cast to unknown (e.g. `as unknown as T`).
- For Python: Use type hints and mypy-compatible annotations.

### 5. Strings
- Use double quotes (`"`) for strings.
- Use string templates or `.join()` instead of operational concatenation.
- Prefer f-strings in Python: `f"Value: {value}"` over `"Value: " + str(value)`.

## ADDITIONAL STANDARDS

### Code Organization
- Follow consistent indentation (4 spaces for Python).
- Group related functions and classes together.
- Use meaningful file and directory names.

### Documentation
- Include README files for projects.
- Document API interfaces and public methods.
- Provide usage examples where appropriate.

### Testing
- Include unit tests for critical functionality.
- Test edge cases and error conditions.
- Provide test coverage for new features.

### Performance
- Consider performance implications of algorithms.
- Use appropriate data structures for the task.
- Avoid unnecessary computations and memory allocations.

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES

### Python Projects
- Use virtual environments for dependency management.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values.
- Implement proper exception handling.

### GUI Applications
- Separate UI logic from business logic.
- Use appropriate widgets for the task.
- Implement responsive design principles.
- Handle user input validation.

### Scientific Computing
- Use appropriate libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).
- Document mathematical formulas and algorithms.
- Provide clear visualizations with proper labels.
- Include error analysis and uncertainty quantification.

## CONTEXT AND MEMORY
- Remember user preferences and project history.
- Maintain consistency across multiple interactions.
- Reference previous solutions and patterns.
- Adapt to user's coding style and preferences.

## COMMUNICATION
- Explain complex concepts clearly.
- Provide step-by-step explanations when needed.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear.
- Suggest improvements and best practices.
